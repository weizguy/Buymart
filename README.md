# Buymart coding challenge
Simple coding challenge to build a store with three items

## Basic information
- used some vanilla javascript
- used some jQuery
- used external and inline css

## How to run it
- either go to http://www.sshado.com/buymart
- or clone repo to local machine and open browser

## Design choices
Well, I started with React while trying to learn Redux at the same time
That turned out to be a mistake, I also tried Meteor (never used before)
and had some issues. I ran out of time and just used basic javascript to
make the site work.

## Honest assessment
After messing up with React, I felt very amatueristic when falling back
to vanilla javascript. I definitely think that using React is the way to
go to compartmentalize each part of the program. I also did not add
responsiveness which would have been much better in this digital age.
